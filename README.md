# Hong Kong Housing Price Prediction (2020-2023)

This project aims to forecast housing prices using machine learning by analysing a Kaggle dataset of residential property transactions in Hong Kong from 2020 to 2023 along with relevant economic indicators, exploring patterns that drive price changes. The goal is to train predictive models that estimate sale prices from property features and macroeconomic data.

# Dataset Description

The primary data is sourced from Kaggle: The primary data is sourced from Kaggle: Hong Kong Housing Price (2020-2023), a CSV dataset scraped from Centaline Property Hong Kong (a major real-estate agency). It contains thousands of records of residential property transactions from 2020 through 2023. Key columns include: 
- Date: the date of the property transaction
- Address: the address of the property
- Floor Plan: --
- Price: the price of the property
- Changes: any changes made to the property since the last transaction
- Saleable Area: the area of the property that can be sold to a buyer
- Unit Rate: the price per square foot of saleable area
- Source: the source of the data (Centaline Property Hong Kong/ Land Registry)
- District: the district in which the property is located in Hong Kong

# Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to:
Explore and visualize the Hong Kong housing data, identifying trends and correlations (by district, time, size, etc.).
Incorporate economic indicators (e.g. GDP growth, interest rates, unemployment, or market indices) as additional features.
Build and train predictive models that estimate housing sale prices from property features and economic data. 
Evaluate and compare models using metrics (RÂ², MAE, RMSE) and choose the best performer.
Visualize model results (e.g. actual vs. predicted prices, feature importances) to interpret performance.
